# SpringBoot-App-Template

This is a template SpringBoot application to be used 
for absolutely anything. Of course you can generate a project
tailored to suit your needs via the initializer 
@https://start.spring.io/
But if you just want to start with an application with basic
configuration and with the `Spring Web` Module loaded then this 
is for you.


#### Maven Commands

- `mvn spring-boot:run` {Starts up the Spring boot application}
- `mvn clean install` {Runs the maven cycle to execute unit test, generate a jar/war and install your package in your local repository}
- `mvn clean tests` {Executes unit tests}
